## A Break after a Long Time

Values: Last weekend, I went on a trip, leaving behind my busy daily life.
As a developer who stares at monitors all day, seeing nature felt like purifying my eyes.

### Where did I go?
I went to see the nearby sea.
Just sitting there blankly listening to the waves was healing.

### What did I eat?
Instead of searching for famous restaurants, I went to a small local restaurant.
The seafood noodle soup I had there was excellent.

### Returning
Now back to daily life, my hands are itching to code again.
I will do my best this week with the recharged energy.
